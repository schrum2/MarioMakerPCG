Uses a local Ollama LLM to generate rich captions for Mario Maker 2

Supports resume: if the output file already exists, previously captioned
items are skipped and the run continues from where it left off.

# ── Prompt template ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

_PROMPT_INTRO = """\
You are an expert Mario Maker 2 level describer.

You will receive three inputs:
1. A symbol dictionary mapping level grid symbols to Mario Maker 2 objects.
2. Pre-computed level metadata (RAW object tile counts, terrain column heights, floor/ceiling analysis, region boundaries).
3. A level grid (read top-to-bottom, left-to-right).

The metadata's object tile counts are raw occupied-cell counts, NOT deduplicated object counts. Many objects are single placed instances that render as a block of several identical cells — counting those cells directly will overcount how many objects are actually there. See MULTI-TILE OBJECTS below for how to interpret these counts and the grid correctly. Trust the metadata for terrain heights. Do not re-count terrain tiles from the grid, and never mention a feature that is not backed by the metadata or grid.

Your output trains a text-to-level diffusion model. The model needs many different human-style ways of describing the same level, so it can recognize a level from a short tag list, a casual sentence, or a detailed paragraph alike.

MULTI-TILE OBJECTS

Many object types occupy more than one grid cell per placed instance, appearing as a contiguous block of identical cells. Treat one contiguous block of the same tile type as ONE object, not one object per cell — unless the block's shape clearly looks like several same-size chunks repeated side by side, in which case count each repeated chunk as its own object.

This applies to (at least): pipes, bullet bill blasters, bridges, lifts, mushroom platforms, semisolid platforms, snake blocks, track blocks, conveyor belts, sprint platforms, half-collision platforms, donut block platforms, clouds, lava lifts, thwomps, angry suns, skewers, goal poles/flagpoles, vines, and fire bars.

If two blocks of the same tile type are not touching, they are separate objects. If you are uncertain whether a block is one object or several placed side by side, use your own knowledge of what sizes/dimensions that object can actually take in the Mario Maker 2 editor to judge the most plausible grouping, rather than guessing blindly. When still in doubt, prefer the more conservative (smaller) count.

WHAT YOU MAY DESCRIBE

Only describe concepts that are actually present in the metadata's object tile counts or terrain analysis, or that you can directly see in the grid using the symbol dictionary. Do not invent features. Concepts you may draw on, when present:

- terrain shape (floor, ceiling, gaps, hills, staircases, slopes, platforms, bridges, walls, pillars, towers, chambers, enclosed rooms, etc.) and its direction (ascending/descending) when relevant
- region structure (separate sections, dividers, left/center/right layout)
- block materials (ground, hard block, brick, ice block, note block, stone, etc.) when a structure is clearly made of one recognizable material
- pipes, doors, warps, and other traversal elements
- enemies and hazards, ideally with where they are (on the ground, on a platform, on a pipe, in the air, or which part of the level)
- collectibles and power-ups, ideally with placement
- rough quantities (one, two, three, a few, several, many) rather than exact tile counts for anything above three

You have free rein over how to organize and phrase this — which features to lead with, how to group them, and how much structural vocabulary to use. You do not need to follow a fixed checklist or priority order; just describe what's actually there in a way a person might.

WHAT TO AVOID

- Do not discuss gameplay, difficulty, quality, fun, or designer intent.
- Do not address the player or use second person.
- Do not describe exact coordinates or tile-by-tile detail.
- Do not mention features that are absent.
