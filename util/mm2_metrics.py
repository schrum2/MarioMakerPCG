"""Metrics over Mario Maker 2 level scenes (68-tile mm2_tileset_we encoding).

1. Broken structure detection. mm2pipeline_data.ascii paints every object as a w x h
   block of one glyph, and mm2pipeline_data.ascii's COALESCE_POLICY records the
   footprint each object should have. A blob that doesn't form its footprint is
   visibly wrong -- the repair pass just stamps it into enough valid objects to
   cover it (a scattered clump of '!' becomes several 2x2 Boom Booms).
   count_structures() applies those footprint rules to count, per feature, the
   instances in a scene and how many are broken.

2. Average Minimum Edit Distance (AMED), self and vs-real, from the previous
   MarioDiffusion paper (util/metrics.py). MM levels come in bucketed sizes, so
   these group by shape and only compare like-sized levels.

3. Maximum edit distance within a group of scenes generated from different
   captions of the same source scene -- high means the captions led to very
   different levels.
