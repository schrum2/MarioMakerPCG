"""
Convert an MM2 level JSON (the toost / level.py export consumed by
json_to_bcd.py) into a Super Mario Maker Worldwide Engine (.swe) save file.

Background
----------
A .swe file is just:

    base64( UTF-8 JSON )  +  40-char lowercase hex HMAC-SHA1 checksum

The checksum is HMAC-SHA1 of the *base64 text* (not the decoded bytes) keyed
with the literal string "2559F35097-2021" (the key shipped in EngineTribe's
SMMWESaveDecryptor; verified here against a real awesome.swe). SMMWE rejects
the file if the checksum doesn't match, so we recompute it exactly.

The decoded JSON has two worlds:

    {"S0": {...overworld...}, "SB1": {...subworld...}}

Each world is a dict of sections:

    S1  list with ONE level-metadata dict (gamestyle, theme, timer, goal, ...)
    S2  ground/terrain tiles      {xx, yy, i}
    S3  decorations               {xx, yy, i, ID, spr}      (left empty here)
    S4  objects / enemies         {xx, yy, ID, scl, dir, ...many flags}
    S5  pipes                     {xx, yy, dir, sz, xscl, yscl, ...}
    S6  "obj_cannon_res" entries  Cannon: {xx, yy, dir, rht, dwn, up, lft}
    S7  "stretchy sprite" objects Bullet Bill Blaster / Semisolid Platform:
                                   {xx, yy, dir, spr, wth, hht, dph, ...}
    S8                             (left empty here)

An unused subworld is written as SB1 = {"S1": []}, matching the editor.

Coordinate systems
-------------------
MM2 JSON                                   SWE
--------                                   ---
ground x,y   tile units, y up from bottom  xx,yy in PIXELS (16 px / tile),
objects x,y  sub-pixels, 160 / tile,         y DOWN from top
             centered, y up from bottom
goal_x       tenths of a tile (goal_x//10)
goal_y       tiles from bottom
boundaries   pixels (16 / tile), top=432

The playfield is 27 tiles (432 px) tall, so a tile at row `r` (from the
bottom) maps to swe_yy = (27 - 1 - r) * 16. Object columns use the viewer's
formula  col = x//160 - w//2 ,  rows  row = y//160  (see mm2_viewer_json.py).
OBJ_LEFT_ANCHOR_IDS use  col = x//160  (no -w//2) instead. For
OBJ_H_ANCHOR_TOP_IDS, row is additionally shifted up by (h-1) tiles, since
their SWE sprite sits at the top of the object's h-tall MM2 footprint, not
its bottom row.

Lossy / best-effort
-------------------
This is a "best effort" conversion, not a perfect round trip:

  * Ground autotiling. SWE stores a resolved tile-graphic index `i` per cell.
    We recompute `i` from 4-neighbour occupancy using a table reverse-
    engineered from a sample level. SMMWE picks random decorative variants,
    so our indices are representative, not identical, but load fine.
  * Object IDs. MM2 uses integer ids (0-132); SWE uses string ids
    (obj_*_res). OBJ_ID_MAP covers the objects SMMWE actually has; anything
    SMMWE lacks (clear pipes, snake/track blocks, most koopalings, tree,
    crate, ...) is dropped with a warning.
  * Bullet Bill Blaster (13), Semisolid Platform (16) and Cannon (47) are
    NOT S4 objects in SMMWE -- they're emitted to S6/S7 by build_cannons /
    build_platform_objects. Confusingly, SMMWE's internal names are swapped
    relative to MM2: the Cannon is "obj_cannon_res" (S6) and the Bullet Bill
    Blaster is "obj_bullebill_base_res" (S7), verified in-game against
    hand-placed reference saves. The Cannon's S6 entry has no size field, so
    its MM2 `h` is lost.
  * Object flags. MM2 packs orientation/wings/parachute/etc. into `flag` /
    `cflag` bitfields whose per-object meaning isn't fully documented. We
    emit the SWE flag fields as 0 (default) and only set scl / a best-effort
    direction. Wings, parachutes, etc. are not carried over.
  * Decorations (S3) and the track object families are not emitted. Slight/
    Steep Slopes (87/88) have no diagonal SWE equivalent, so their full
    w x h bounding box is filled in as solid S2 ground instead.

Usage
-----
    python json_to_swe.py bcd_levels/json/<id>_overworld.json
    python json_to_swe.py bcd_levels/json/<id>_overworld.json -o <filename>.swe
    python json_to_swe.py <id>_overworld.json --user <exact_username> --name <placeholder name>

If a matching *_subworld.json sits next to the overworld file it is converted
into SB1 automatically.

    consumed_plants is a set of id() values for Piranha Plant (id=2) objects

    emitted as standalone S4 objects by build_objects.

    Reverse-engineered from four hand-placed length-4 pipes (one per
    direction) saved directly from the SMMWE editor -- both earlier S5
    endpoint-based schemes and an S4 "obj_tuberia_res" attempt were wrong.
    The four samples (sz, xscl/yscl, sclx, rot, dir, t_x_pos-xx, t_y_pos-yy):

        U: sz=2 yscl=2 xscl=1 sclx=1  rot=0    dir=0  t_x-xx=32 t_y-yy=32

        L: sz=2 yscl=1 xscl=2 sclx=-1 rot=-270 dir=3  t_x-xx=32 t_y-yy=0

    All four were length 4 (sz = length - 2 = 2). The pattern: `dir` is
    0/1/2/3 for U/R/D/L (clockwise), rot = -90*dir (dir=2 shown as +180),
    sclx flips to -1 for the "second half" (D/L), the length axis is yscl
    for vertical (U/D) and xscl for horizontal (R/L), t_x_pos is always
    xx+32, and t_y_pos is yy+32 only for U (else yy).

    (xx,yy) is the TOP-LEFT corner of the pipe's MM2 tile footprint, per
    obj_anchor()/obj_tile_size() in mm2_viewer_json.py (no `-w//2`
    correction; `length` always comes from `h` regardless of direction).

    obj_anchor()/obj_tile_size() use for those directions (e.g. R's
    bottom-left (base_col, base_row-1) with a 2-row-tall footprint gives
    top-left (base_col, base_row), matching the formula below) -- but the

    field, so MM2's `h` cannot be represented and is dropped.

    up/dwn/dir are not stored in MM2's `flag` in a reverse-engineered form,
    so they're inferred from adjacent terrain/objects in `occ` (see
    occupied_cells), verified against the 21 cannons in a real level:

      * A solid cell directly above the footprint means the cannon is
        ceiling-mounted (up=1, dwn=0).
      * A ceiling-mounted cannon with open space directly below shoots
        straight down (dir=6) -- this is the common "turret in an open
        room" case (confirmed: 3 single-tile + 1 big ceiling cannon in an
        open alcove all shoot down, regardless of side walls).
      * A ceiling-mounted cannon with something solid directly below (e.g.
        embedded in the face of a pillar) instead faces away from an
        adjacent side wall (dir=0 right / dir=4 left).
      * Everything else is floor-mounted, facing right (dwn=1, dir=0) --
        side-wall-based left/right facing for floor cannons was tried and
        produced a false positive, so floor cannons always face right.

    A floor-mounted "big" (h>1) cannon's MM2 bounding box is embedded in
    the ground it's mounted on -- only the row above the box (row+h, the
    same row the ceiling-check above confirms is open) is clear, so that's
    where the single S6 tile is placed; h==1 cannons keep the existing
    top-of-footprint placement (row+h-1 == row).

    `flag` bit 26 (1<<26) is set on every cannon whose dir mapping above

    S7 is a "stretchy sprite" object: `spr` selects the themed sprite and
    `wth`/`hht` size it (in MM2 tile units). Position reuses the
    centered/left-anchor + top-of-footprint formula from object_cell /
    OBJ_H_ANCHOR_TOP_IDS. wth/hht = w,h directly -- verified against two
    8-entry hand-placed reference grids (a "staircase" of 3x3/3x4/3x5/3x6
    and a "different width" set of 3x3/4x3/5x3/6x3 Semisolid Platforms),
    which gave wth==w and hht==h exactly in all 8 cases. `dph` doesn't
    appear to affect rendering and is left at the constant from the
    original single-object reference of each type (255 / 0).

    Seesaw (91) and Lift (11) both use "obj_platform_res" (a vertically-
    moving platform). Seesaw was verified via a hand-placed reference save
    ("platform example.swe") containing wth=4/6/8 examples:
    spr="spr_<gamestyle>_platform", dph=-1, dir=2, hht=3 (constant, the
    sprite's fixed vertical travel height, independent of the seesaw's h).
    wth = max(4, w) -- the seesaw's width, with a minimum of 4 (per the
    reference's "default" size) -- giving a best-effort "platform as big as
    the seesaw, that goes up and down".

    Lift's S4 mapping to the same "obj_platform_res" ID was missing the
    dph/wth/hht/spr fields obj_platform_res requires, crashing
    instance_create_depth on entering play mode ("argument 2 ... expecting a
    Number") in any level containing a Lift. Routed here with the same
    dph=-1/dir=2/spr as the (working) seesaw mapping, but hht=1 to match
    Lift's actual h=1 footprint (seesaw's hht=3 was seesaw-specific).

    Bridge (17) / Castle Bridge (49) -> "obj_puente_res", left-anchored
    (OBJ_LEFT_ANCHOR_IDS) like the other stretchy platforms. wth=w (MM2
    enforces a minimum bridge width of 3, matching the reference's
    smallest example); hht=3/dph=8/dir=0/spr=PUENTE_SPRITE are constant,
    verified against all 5 widths (3-7) in "bridge example .swe".

    Mushroom Platform (14) -> "obj_mushroom_platform_res", a single S7
